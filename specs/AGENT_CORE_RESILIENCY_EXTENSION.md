This is the logical next step for AgentCore. If the High-Reliability Engineering (HRE) extension ensures the code is structurally sound, this extension ensures the system can survive the chaotic reality of the cloud and mobile networks.

Here is the detailed specification document for integrating these advanced architectural patterns into your framework. You can save this as `docs/core/AGENT_CORE_RESILIENCY_EXTENSION.md`.

# AgentCore: Advanced Cloud-Native & Resiliency Extension 🌩️

**Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** To upgrade AgentCore's architectural guidelines to support distributed systems, mathematically proven state machines, and fault-tolerant cloud environments. This bridges the gap between clean code and unbreakable infrastructure.

---

## 1. The Twelve-Factor App (Cloud-Native Architecture)

The Twelve-Factor methodology ensures applications are built for portability, scalability, and stateless execution. For AgentCore, this means the AI must treat the application as a disposable compute unit that relies entirely on the environment for context and backing services (like PostgreSQL or Solid Queue) for state.

### Core Principles

* **Config in the Environment:** Strict separation of config from code. Credentials or hostnames must never exist in the codebase.
* **Stateless Processes:** The app executes as a share-nothing process. Any data that needs to persist must be stored in a stateful backing service.
* **Dev/Prod Parity:** Keep development, staging, and production as identical as possible (e.g., using PostgreSQL locally instead of falling back to SQLite if production uses PostgreSQL).

### AI Implementation Strategy

* **Create `SKILL: audit-twelve-factor`:** A validation script the AI runs before finalizing any deployment-related code or environment configuration.
* **Prompt Engineering (The "Config Guard"):** ```xml
<twelve_factor_rules>
1. REJECT any hardcoded API keys, URLs, or environment-specific toggles in Ruby or TypeScript files.
2. FORCE the use of `ENV.fetch('KEY')` in Rails, explicitly requiring a fallback or failing fast.
3. VALIDATE that Kamal deployment configurations (`deploy.yml`) pull secrets securely from the environment, not from committed files.
</twelve_factor_rules>


```


```

## 2. Design by Contract (DbC) / Defensive Programming

DbC forces components to agree on strict obligations before interacting. Instead of writing endless `if` statements to handle bad data deep in the system, components fail immediately at the boundary if the contract is violated.

### Core Principles

* **Preconditions:** The caller must guarantee specific data states before invoking a method.
* **Postconditions:** The method guarantees a specific output state upon completion.
* **Invariants:** Class-level truths that must remain valid before and after every public method invocation.

### AI Implementation Strategy

* **The `strict-service` Playbook:** Instruct the AI to build Ruby Service Objects and TypeScript classes as fortified boundaries.
* **Prompt Engineering:**
```text
When generating a Service Object or an API endpoint:
1. Define PRECONDITIONS explicitly at the top of the method using Ruby `raise ArgumentError` or early returns for invalid TypeScript payloads.
2. Define POSTCONDITIONS before the final return statement to verify the mutation succeeded.
3. Do not assume the database or external API will sanitize the data for you. Fail fast.

```

## 3. Mutation Testing (Advanced Verification)

Standard test coverage only proves that a line of code was executed, not that the test actually enforces the logic. Mutation testing modifies the source code in memory (e.g., changing `>` to `>=`) and runs the test suite. If the tests still pass, the mutant "survived," exposing a worthless test.

### Core Principles

* **Kill the Mutants:** A test suite is only valid if it fails when the underlying logic is intentionally broken.
* **Quality Over Quantity:** 50% mutation coverage is often more valuable than 100% line coverage.

### AI Implementation Strategy

* **The "Mutant Hunter" Persona:** The AI cannot easily run mutation testing itself, but it can *analyze* the output of tools like the `mutant` gem (Ruby) or `Stryker` (TypeScript).
* **Create `SKILL: resolve-surviving-mutants`:** 1. The developer runs the mutation framework and pipes the output to a file: `mutant_report.txt`.
2. The AI reads the report.
3. **Prompt Definition:** *"Read `mutant_report.txt`. Identify which tests allowed mutated code to survive. Rewrite the RSpec or Vitest blocks to establish tighter assertions that will kill these specific mutants."*

## 4. Chaos Engineering (System Resiliency)

Systems fail in unpredictable ways: mobile networks drop, Solid Cable WebSockets disconnect, and API rate limits trigger. Chaos engineering actively injects these failures during development to ensure the app degrades gracefully.

### Core Principles

* **Assume Hostile Infrastructure:** The network is unreliable, latency is not zero, and bandwidth is not infinite.
* **Graceful Degradation:** When a dependency fails, the system should offer a fallback UI or offline mode, not a crash screen.

### AI Implementation Strategy

* **The "Chaos Architect" Protocol:** When the AI designs an integration between the Mobile apps and the Rails backend, it must explicitly document the failure modes.
* **Prompt Engineering:**
```xml
<chaos_engineering_mandate>
  Whenever implementing an external API call, a database query, or a WebSocket connection:
  1. Draft a `failure_matrix.md` detailing what happens on timeout, 500 error, and empty response.
  2. Implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures (e.g., using Solid Queue's retry mechanisms).
  3. Ensure Mobile TypeScript clients implement Optimistic UI updates and cache state locally if the Rails backend is unreachable.
</chaos_engineering_mandate>

```

## 5. Formal Methods & TLA+ (Mathematical Correctness)

For highly complex, distributed state machines (like resolving data conflicts when a mobile app syncs offline data back to the Rails API), unit tests cannot cover every possible race condition. TLA+ models the system mathematically to prove that deadlocks or data corruption are impossible.

### Core Principles

* **State Space Exploration:** Proving that no matter what order events occur, the system remains in a valid state.
* **Specification Before Code:** Writing the mathematical model before touching Ruby or TypeScript.

### AI Implementation Strategy

* **The "TLA+ Translator" Skill:** AI models are excellent at reading TLA+ or PlusCal specifications and translating them into code.
* **Process Flow:**
1. Write a high-level PlusCal specification of your mobile-to-backend sync logic in `docs/core/sync_model.tla`.
2. Use a TLA+ checker locally to verify it.
3. **Prompt Definition:** *"Read `sync_model.tla`. This state machine has been mathematically verified. Generate the Rails Controller and TypeScript Mobile Service that strictly implement this exact state machine. Do not introduce any intermediate states not defined in the TLA+ file."*

## 🚀 Next Step

To make this actionable in your workspace, we should build the first physical AgentCore Skill file for one of these disciplines.

**Would you like me to draft the exact `.cursor/skills/audit-twelve-factor.md` file, or would you prefer to build the prompt template that forces the AI to apply Design by Contract (DbC) to your Rails Service Objects?**
