# AI Developer Protocol & Refactoring Playbook

**Goal:** Replicate the "Deep Clean" process used across software projects to eliminate fragmentation, redundancy, and drift in documentation, and to optimize AI Agent workflows for the specific tech stack.

**Instruction to AI:** Execute this playbook phase by phase. Do not skip to solutions; perform the analysis first.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery & Inventory

**Goal:** Understand what we have.

1.  **List & Group:** List all files in `docs/` and group them by "Domain" (e.g., UI, Backend, Process, Legacy).
2.  **Identify "Split Brains":** finding multiple documents that seem to cover the same topic (e.g., `ui_plan.md` and `ui_rebuild.md`, or `auth_flow_v1.md` and `AUTHENTICATION.md`).
3.  **Identify "Snapshots":** Find documents that look like point-in-time audits or specific task plans (e.g., `CODE_REVIEW_7df209c.md`, `feature_xyz_notes.md`) rather than living documentation.

## Phase 2: Redundancy Analysis (The "Dry" Check)

**Goal:** Find repeated information.

1.  **Cursorrules Check:** Compare `docs/` against `.cursorrules`.
    - _Question:_ Is `docs/tech_stack.md` just a copy of the "Tech Stack" section in `.cursorrules`?
    - _Question:_ Does `docs/component_library.md` repeat rules already defined in `.cursorrules`?
2.  **Cross-Doc Check:** Do disparate docs repeat the same architectural patterns?

## Phase 3: Drift Analysis (Truth vs. Reality)

**Goal:** Ensure docs match the code.

1.  **Spec Audit:** Compare `docs/SPEC.md` against the core data layer (e.g., `app/models/`, `db/schema.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`). Are there models missing from the Spec? Are there relationships described in Spec that don't exist?
2.  **UI Audit:** Compare UI docs (if any) against the frontend components directory (e.g., `app/components/`, `src/views/`).

## Artifact Strategy (The "Wisdom" of Execution)

**Key Lesson:** The analysis phase generates meaningful artifacts (Inventory, Redundancy Analysis, Drift Analysis). These become "stale" the moment you execute fixes, but they are valuable audit logs.

- **Create** these artifacts in a temporary location or root `docs/` during analysis.
- **Move** them to `docs/audit/` with a descriptive date stamp (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_AI_AUDIT_PHASE_1_INVENTORY.md`) upon completion.

## Phase 4: Reconciliation (The Fix)

**Goal:** Resolve the drifts identified in Phase 3 while future-proofing the documentation.

1.  **Code vs. Spec Decision:** For each drift, decide: _Is the Code wrong, or is the Spec wrong?_ (Ask the user).
2.  **Execute Fix:** Update the code or the spec accordingly.
3.  **Add a Domain Glossary:** Add a strict terminology glossary to `SPEC.md`. This prevents AI from hallucinating standard industry definitions when the project uses specific internal terminology.
4.  **Deep-Link Feature Specs from Core:** Explicitly link feature-specific documents from the core `SPEC.md` using markdown links (e.g., `> **Implementation Deep Dive:** See [docs/features/FEATURE_NAME.md]`). This teaches the AI exactly where to look next.

## Phase 5: Consolidation & Cleanup

**Goal:** Execute the proposal from Phase 2 and optimize document storage.

1.  **Organize `docs/` Hierarchy:**
    - Group documents into logical subdirectories (e.g., `core/`, `features/`, `ai/`, `audit/`) so AI agents can be targeted to specific folders (e.g., `@docs/features/`) without polluting their context window.
2.  **Merge Split Brains:**
    - Read the source file (e.g., `obsolete_auth.md`).
    - Append its relevant content to the target file (e.g., `AUTH_SPEC.md`).
    - Delete the source file.
3.  **Archive Snapshots:** Move point-in-time docs to `docs/audit/` with a date prefix.
4.  **Final Sweep:** Move the analysis artifacts (Inventory, Redundancy, Drift reports) to `docs/audit/` with date prefixes.

## Phase 6: AI Agent & Workflow Optimization

**Goal:** Ensure AI assistants operate seamlessly within the project's specific tech stack, follow interactive, safe workflows, and maintain documentation hygiene.

1.  **Agent SOP Refactor:**
    - Consolidate AI rules into `.cursorrules` to act as an **IF/THEN routing table**.
    - Do not duplicate standard formatting rules. Keep `.cursorrules` as the single source of truth for both standards and workflow routing.
    - Delete legacy directories like `.agent/` so all tools share a single source of truth and avoid "Split Brain" AI instructions.
2.  **Skill Refinement (Local & Async Loops):**
    - Update universal workflow skills (e.g., `start-feature`, `finish-branch`, `status-check`) to enforce interactive pauses.
    - **Start Feature:** Ensure the AI forces a Q&A discovery phase, drafts a hierarchical `implementation_plan.md`, and loops through a strict TDD process step-by-step.
    - **Finish Branch:** Ensure the AI handles async loops (like waiting for remote bot reviews on GitHub) by pausing and waiting for the user to provide feedback in loops.
    - **Status Check:** Ensure the skill can rehydrate context by reading the `implementation_plan.md`, codebase, and test suite to pinpoint exactly _Who_ is blocking progress.
    - **Harvest Rules:** Ensure rule extraction pauses for explicit user approval before writing to `.cursorrules`.
3.  **Playbook Documentation:**
    - Ensure `docs/ai/AI_WORKFLOW_PLAYBOOK.md` exists to document the exact purpose and triggers for all Custom Skills in the project, providing a clear reference manual for current and future developers.
4.  **Prevent Future "Drift" via PR Templates:**
    - Add required checkboxes to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` forcing developers to attest they have updated `SPEC.md` (if schema changes) or `REPLICATION_BLUEPRINT.md` (if the stack changes).
